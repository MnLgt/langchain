With our sincerity, we would like to accept the USD $12,000 to settle the uses of Freeplay’s music and are ready to move forward to the next step, making an settlement agreement.  Please pass our reply on to Freeplay.



Besides, we have reported to the negotiation progress to Toyota Motor Corporation(“TMC”) and heard that other companies in Toyota system around the world had started to make contact with you as well.  Since TMC respect each company’s independence, hope you will understand that the consensus we have reached does not guarantee  or affect others’ final decision.



Thank you for your assistance.

Subject: RE: Explains from Distributor of Toyota product in Taiwan regarding Copyright claims



For Settlement Purposes Only



Dear Yuyen,



Thank you for your email, and for forwarding over the email correspondence from Freeplay. Freeplay checked their files, and they located the attached license document with Occupy Ad Co Ltd, which appears to relate to the video projects at issue.



As you can see, that license permitted a “Non-Broadcast Multimedia” use in the territory of Taiwan for a six month period beginning on June 25, 2012.  A “Non-Broadcast Multimedia” license covers uses such as live events, power point presentations, or video productions used at tradeshows or conventions. That license does not encompass use on YouTube or anywhere else on the internet. Accordingly, it appears that any use of Freeplay’s music by Occupy Ad Co Ltd or Hotai Motor on the internet was not authorized by the license obtained from Freeplay.



With that in mind, Freeplay has prepared a proposed settlement offer. There are a variety of factors that Freeplay considers when proposing an offer to settle. These factors include, without limitation: commercial considerations of the parties and uses; the need to protect compensation to writers and music publishers; the number of copyrights used; the number of copyrighted tracks used; the medium and platforms utilized for exploiting the new works; the nature, character, and type of use found in these works; the license fee that would have been charged if the use were authorized ahead of time; and the length of time that the productions were posted, both before and after the user was provided notice. Here, there were 4 uses of 2 works in 2 Internet video productions. The Uses were broadcast for approximately 6 years. Our client also considers the time and resources devoted to pursuing the detections to date. Based on its current evaluation of this matter, Freeplay Music, LLC is willing to accept USD $12,000 to settle the uses of its music.



While our client is fully prepared to defend its rights, they would prefer to resolve this matter amicably. To that end, if you accept Freeplay’s settlement offer, please let me know and I will prepare a draft settlement agreement for you. If you have any questions, please let me know. I look forward to your response.



Regards,

Jessica

Dear Jessica, 



We are sorry for the late reply due to the Chinese Lunar New Year vacation.



As for the name of the third party company who created the videos at issue (the“Producer”), we were in contract with a marketing company named 「超勝」 in the first place actually.  However, we are not sure whether the Producer came into contact with Freeplay on behalf of the company or by an individual.  Attached herewith a copy of letter between the Producer and Freeplay. Hoping Freeplay could identify the Producer with it.



Thank you again for passing the information to Freeplay.  We look forward to hearing from you.



Best Regards,

Yuyen

Dear Yuyen,



Thank you for your email, and for your attention to this matter. My client appreciates the investigation you have conducted thus far, and your willingness to discuss an amicable resolution of this matter.



As a first step, would you mind providing the name of the third party company that created the videos at issue (the “Producer”)? Freeplay would like to check its records to confirm the dates that the Producer provided to you regarding the license that the Producer claims it obtained. Once Freeplay has confirmed those dates, I will provide you with their proposed settlement offer.



Again, Freeplay appreciates your cooperation, and looks forward to resolving this matter in a mutually agreeable fashion. I look forward to your response.



Regards,

Jessica

Subject: Explains from Distributor of Toyota product in Taiwan regarding Copyright claims



Dear Jessica,



This email is from Hotai Motor Co. Ltd., the Distributor of Toyota product in Taiwan (hereinafter referred to as “Hotai”).  I am Yuyen who is in charge of this music copyright matter.  You may contact me directly if you need any further discussion.



As you may know, the alleged music copyright infringing videos of YouTube Channel “Toyota TW” were uploaded by Hotai. However, the above-mentioned videos were made by the third company (hereinafter referred to as “the Producer”).  Hotai did make an agreement with the Producer in June 2012 (hereinafter referred to as “the Agreement”) and required the Producer to assure no copyright infringement in making any films or videos.  Further, according to the Agreement, the Producer shall obtain EVERY license (including music licenses) from the copyright holder for Hotai to utilize the videos for an unlimited time and in unlimited areas.  



However, the Producer only obtained the music licenses of the above-mentioned videos until September, 2013.  Even though the Producer got a renewal notice from Freeplay on September 27th, 2013, the Producer didn’t renew the music licenses nor informed Hotai.  It was not until Hotai got a notice from Toyota Motor Corporation on July 21 th, 2017, that Hotai just realized the Producer did not renew the music licenses.  And that caused the above-mentioned videos to become infringing ones.  With high respect to the copyright owner and related laws, Hotai immediately removed all the above-mentioned videos.  As to the Producer’s breach of the Agreement, Hotai has conducted legal actions to the Producer.



We sincerely hope that Tunesat/Freeplay would understand that Hotai unintentionally made the above-mentioned videos accessible on YouTube after the music licenses expired, i.e. September 27th, 2013.  Furthermore, to show our respect to the music copyright owner, Hotai would like to make compensation to Tunesat/Freeplay for the period of the unlicensed music utilized.  We believe that the period should be from September, 2013 to August, 2017.



In this regard, if it is possible, please kindly inform us what kind of compensation would be acceptable to Tunesat/Freeplay to settle this music copyright matter.  We highly appreciate your understanding and look forward to hearing from you. Thank you very much.

.



Best Regards, 

Yuyen
