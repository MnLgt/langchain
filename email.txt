Dear Momchil, 



It has been six weeks since I last heard from you, and approximately three months since you agreed to resolve this matter for a one-time payment of $600. Freeplay needs to conclude this matter. Please let me know by Monday, April 2 if you will be providing a signed copy of the settlement agreement. If I do not hear from you, Freeplay will need to consider escalation, and may need to reach back out to Toyota to resolve this matter.

Jessica

Hi Momchil,



Thank you for your email. Please see the attached revised agreement. I added the YouTube channel and title of the video as it appeared on YouTube to Exhibit A to clarify the production that is being referred to. Please let me know if I have somehow mis-copied any of the text.



If this looks good to you, please let me know the address you would like listed for your company, and I will send you a final PDF for you to sign. Let me know if there are any other questions.

Hello Jesica,

sorry for the delay. I confirm my previous statement & I will complete a payment of 600$ according to our agreement. I went through the Settlement Agreement, could you please include a description of the end product that the recording was used in (something in addition to the link provided in Exhibit A, for example, Video used by Toyota Bulgaria on YouTube) just to make sure that no future misunderstandings on this particular matter could arise?



Thank you in advance

Dear Momchil,



It has now been almost two months since I last heard from you. In your email of December 20, you represented that you would complete a payment of $600 in January 2018. We have not received any such payment or any comments to the draft settlement agreement.



Freeplay would like to wrap this matter up and move on. Accordingly, please provide any comments to the draft agreement by Monday, February 19. If you have no comments, please let me know so we can arrange to have the document signed.

Dear Momchil,



Thank you for your email. I have reviewed your proposal with Freeplay. While Freeplay appreciates your continued efforts to resolve this matter, I must emphasize that the actual license fees that would have been incurred had the appropriate license been secured in advance would have totaled approximately $1,250. With that in mind, Freeplay generally cannot settle an unlicensed use for less than half of what it would have expected to earn in license fees had the necessary licenses been secured upfront.



However, having considered the circumstances at hand, and in an effort to resolve this matter as efficiently as possible, Freeplay has authorized me to make the following proposal:



Freeplay will accept a total settlement amount of $600 if you are able to pay the complete amount in a single payment. However, if you require that the settlement amount be broken into installments, Freeplay will accept a total settlement amount of $750, to be paid as follows:



Jan 2018 - $150

Feb 2018 - $150

Mar 2018 - $150

Apr 2018 - $150

May 2018 - $150



Please let me know if either of those proposals is acceptable to you and I will prepare a draft agreement for your review.



I look forward to your response.



Regards,

Jessica

sorry for my delayed answer, I am really busy lately. As you well know I am trying to be constructive and realistic in finding a solution to this misunderstanding. Based on all circumstances discussed in previous emails I can offer the following payment plan:

Jan 2018 - 150$

Feb 2018 - 150$

Mar 2018 - 150$

Apr 2018 - 150$



It really is the best I can do & I hope your colleagues from FreePlayMusic are satisfied with my fair proposal.

If you need additional cooperation from me I remain at your disposal.

Dear Momchil,



Thank you for your email.



For all of the reasons that I have stated in my previous emails, Freeplay believes that its settlement offer remains a reasonable proposal. However, it is sensitive to your concerns and wants to find a resolution that will work for both parties.



Freeplay does remain willing to consider an alternative proposal, but it cannot negotiate against itself. Accordingly, please make a counter-proposal, including the proposed payment totals and schedule for Freeplay’s consideration.



If you have any questions or wish to discuss, please let me know.

Hello Jessica,



I respect the points raised in your previous email. As I have told you I am trying to find fair and reasonable solution to this misunderstanding. Freeplay’s current conditions are much diffetent to all other companies offering music for production purposes. I am not aware for how long these conditions have been valid. Based on current market reality the payment you request is similar to national TV campain (with music included) or complete online campaign with creative, production, music etc all included.

On top of that the music in question was not used in its entirety and it is obvious that this is not willfull wrongdoing but misunderstanding around Freeplay’s conditions. 

Based on all said I would like to ask for your understanding and cooperation about finding fair and reasonable solution. Thank you in advance, I remain at your disposal.



Best regards, Mono
